Atari 400, 800, 800XL, 130XE, 5200 emulator

Atari 800 ROM is freely available as part of the package, i've included them here but the roms are supposed to be part of a .zip package for an old DOS emulator I figure it's been such a long time that I'll save the download step for users and have the 800xl rom in place...Contact me if this is an issue ...
